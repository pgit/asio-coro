# Sample JSON files — source and usage

The sample JSON files come from the Microsoft Edge Demos project: https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/json-dummy-data/. They are simple dummy datasets (people, products, orders, posts, comments, etc.) provided for demos, UI testing, and development experiments by the Microsoft Edge team and hosted via GitHub Pages.
